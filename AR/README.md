### How to use: UI Guide
* This build was developed with users mostly using mobile devices, therefore there is a black crosshair(+) in the middle of the screen. Said crosshair is what selects the object, therefore clicking or tapping anywhere on the screen will trigger the crosshair, not where has been clicked. 
* The sliders at the bottom adjust the minimum and the maximum tag count displayed. For example, if the minimum is set to "10", then the graph will show me tag spheres that had been generated at least 10 times.
* When you click/tap to select a sphere, a popup will show up from the bottom of the screen with various related data. If you wish to leave this screen, click/tap the button in the lower right corner.
* The button in the top right corner opens a Sub Cluster Menu, which lets you narrow down the visualization to five tags + similar tags. The box right under the selector displays links connected with the Sub Cluster
