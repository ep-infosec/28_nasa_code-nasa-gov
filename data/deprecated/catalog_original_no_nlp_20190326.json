It includes a tutorial on structural finite element modeling (FEM_Tutorial.m) using elements such as 12 DOF plates and 6 DOF beams. The aero tutorial (DLM_VLM_Tutorial.m) shows how to code doublet lattice and vortex lattice, with symmetry capability. Together the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, as well as wind tunnel testing. The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a PID control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots determined using the K-method are also included. The code is commented for Graduate and Undergraduate students of aeroservoelasticity who want to know the basic concepts of medium fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling. Not all methods are coded to industry standards. But students of the field including practicing engineers may find it useful for basic understanding; theoretical manuals for industry level codes tend to leave out many of the coding details. All of the details of the code are open sourced here and most of it is referenced at the top of the file to its source paper or book section. Two AIAA publications with one focusing on V&V with experimental wind tunnel test and ground vibration test data are also included.",

        "Description": "The IVHM Project in the Aviation Safety Program has funded research in electrical power system (EPS) health management. This problem domain contains both discrete and continuous behavior, and thus is directly relevant for the hybrid diagnostic tool HyDE. In FY2007 work was performed to expand the HyDE diagnosis model of the ADAPT system. The work completed resulted in a HyDE model with the capability to diagnose five times the number of ADAPT components than was previously tested. The expanded diagnosis model passed a corresponding set of new ADAPT fault injection scenario tests with no incorrect faults reported. The time required for the HyDE diagnostic system to isolate the fault varied widely between tests; this variance was reduced by tuning of the HyDE input parameters. These results and other diagnostic design tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, possible future improvements for both the HyDE diagnostic model and HyDE itself are presented.",

        "Description": "This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",

Currently, however, many developing nations lack the in-country expertise and computational infrastructure to utilize remote sensing data.\r\n\r\nThe CEOS Data Cube Platform provides a flexible model to address these needs.  The CEOS Data Cube Platform is a data processing platform for Earth science data, with a focus on remote-sensing data.  The platform provides a data ingestion framework that includes support for automated ingestion of a wide variety of remote sensing data products.  The data products are ingested into an N-dimensional data array that abstracts away management of distinct acquisitions.   The platform has a tiered API for data processing and a data/application platform layer for higher-level access.",

The problem of severe heat is notably felt in Maricopa County, Arizona, where the socially disadvantaged and physically vulnerable are especially susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Several organizations, including the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Phoenix Heat Relief Network, are working to create more effectively placed cooling centers and heat warning systems to aid those with the highest risk of exposure. This project created a Python tool using Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface temperature parameters to generate heat maps that reference demographics data on extreme heat days.

The intended applications of PolyCARP are related, but not limited, to safety critical systems in air traffic management. One application is weather avoidance. A weather cell can be approximated by a polygon, and PolyCARP provides algorithms to detect whether a trajectory will intersect such a polygon in the near future and will provide maneuver guidance to avoid the polygon. If the trajectory is inside the polygon at the current time, PolyCARP provides algorithms for maneuver guidance to exit the polygon. Another application is ensuring that an aircraft stays inside a predetermined safety region, also known as assured containment, and PolyCARP provides algorithms that ensure that a point is inside or outside a particular polygonal region. Another application is obstacle avoidance by an aircraft. There are several functionalities provided by PolyCARP. There are algorithms to insure that a point is contained in or excluded from a polygon. There are also collision detection algorithms that determine if a moving point intersects a polygon, including the case where the polygon is moving or even warping over time, as well as where the polygon and the point are following piecewise linear trajectories. There are algorithms that resolve potential collisions between and point and a polygon by providing collision-free trajectories, and there are algorithms that compute new trajectories to regain separation from a polygon.",

The EEFS can be used on embedded systems where a file system is needed to access data from EEPROM, PROM, or RAM memory, but otherwise might not have the resources to deploy a full file system such as the MSDOS file system. The EEPROM file system can also be used in systems where the ability to dump, patch, and diagnose files is required. ",

OpenMDAO is the open source framework developed by NASA that will be accessible via an open source website to reach the entire broad based MDAO community to facilitate advancing the science of MDAO.  MDAO covers a vast set of capabilities, including a flexible framework and state of the art discipline codes.  This innovation relates specifically to the framework.  OpenMDAO provides the core software infrastructure to integrate multidisciplinary variable fidelity tools and enable design, analysis, and optimization of complex systems.  Currently, the OpenMDAO version 0.1 functionalities include component linking, data passing, driver interface, and lazy evaluation.  This initial basic capability of the framework is sufficient for users to run and optimize their analysis after they integrate their specific component codes.  As OpenMDAO evolves, the following capabilities will be included in the framework:  interprocess communications, error handling, user interfaces, geometry application program interfaces (APIs), plug-in interfaces, utilities to wrap tools, versioning, and parallel processing support.  To be clear, the framework will enable the integration of, but will not include: optimizers, solvers, visualization tools, custom data types, script components, and discipline codes.  AEROSPACE:  To meet the present and future economic and environmental challenges facing air transportation, aviation design must expand its focus from today's conventional \"wing-body-tail\" aircraft to more advanced vehicles.   The ability to design revolutionary aircraft to improve mobility and air transport efficiency is of paramount importance to the national economy, along with reducing our environmental impact and supporting national defense.   Technologies such as the one disclosed here incorporate progressively more sophisticated computational models and methods, enabling future aircraft designs today.",

Trick simulations are used all across NASA for simulations that support human spaceflight activities. However, until now, there were no means to use FMI based models in a Trick based simulation or a method for providing Trick based models that were FMI compliant. This software provides implementation software to do both. There are two principal components to the software: A C based software implementation for wrapping Trick based C models that provide an FMI compliant interface; A collection of C++ classes that can be used in a Trick based simulation to use an FMI compliant model (FMU).",

A python script will pull out timing, brightness temperatures, and other information  from each channel/geolocation and store them as attributes using the appropriate type of numpy array. The approach consists of ingesting the entire file as a text string and then parsing and converting as necessary. The file is read and the data are populated when the class is instantiated with the full path and name of an AMPR file. Numerous visualization methods are provided, including track plots, strip charts, and Google Earth KMZs. In addition, polarization deconvolution is available.",

        "Description": "This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",

The emphasis has been on development of an analysis capability for application at the structural level. Hence, modeling of damage progression is undertaken at the meso-scale, where each ply of a laminate is represented as a homogenous orthotropic continuum. All of the composite damage mechanisms (matrix cracking, fiber breaking and kinking, and delamination) and their interactions are represented. The CompDam software is implemented as user written subroutines for use with the Abaqus commercial finite element code.  Input for CompDam includes ply-level material properties, and interface properties obtained from standard material characterization tests.  The output from CompDam includes damage variables associated with each damage mode. These damage variables describe the evolution of damage and are used to generate updated structural constitutive matrices and load redistribution as damage evolves. ",

These tools support the typical workflow in high performance computing environments where users compress large files and/or aggregate multiple small files into a single archive during remote transfers. Once uncompressed/unarchived into their original form, these files will be optimally striped for subsequent operations.",

The variable emissivity radiator aerogel insulation blanket dual zone thermal control experiment suite for responsive space (STP-H3-VADER) investigation tests a variable emissivity radiator and a new form of multilayer insulation that uses Aerogel as the thermal isolator in order to protect the spacecraft from the harsh extremes of the space environment. The Aerogel material provides a more durable, lighter and cheaper alternative to traditional spacecraft thermal blankets. The use of this material could reduce the costs related to spaceflight by reducing the required spacecraft mass and increasing design efficiency.",

The only required inputs are the surface crack dimensions (2c and a), plate cross-section dimensions (W and B), and linear plus power law material properties of elastic modulus, yield strength, and strain hardening coefficient. With the geometry and material parameters entered, TASC interpolates to the appropriate J(\u03a6) vs. crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and far-field tension stress, \u03c3, vs. CMOD solution, providing the full solution as CMOD ranges from zero out to the CMOD limit of the solution space for the given input parameters. TASC was developed by the Material and Processes Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.",

Multi-node cooperation allows different nodes to take part in the same task. Split file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file. Finally, additional optimizations such as buffer management help eliminate other bottlenecks that can reduce performance. Mutil currently includes drop-in replacements for cp and md5sum from GNU coreutils, which have achieved 10/30x rates on one/many nodes.",

Mesh adheres to fundamental security principles and was designed to be compatible with strong security mechanisms including two-factor authentication, SSH bastions, and restrictive firewalls.

This provides analysts with a coherent description of the anomalies identified in the sequence, and why they differ from more 'normal' sequences.",

The reason for having four different methods of FITS I/O with IDL is partly historical, as different groups developed the software independently. However, each method also has its own strengths and weakness for any particular task. For example, the procedure MRDFITS() -- which can read a FITS table into an IDL structure --is the easiest procedure for analyzing FITS files at the IDL prompt level (provided that one is comfortable with IDL structures). But mapping a table into an IDL structure includes extra overhead, so that when performing FITS I/O at the procedure level, it may be desirable to use more efficient procedures such as FITS_READ and FTAB_EXT.",

The radiometric processing subsystem characterizes and corrects, where possible, radiometric qualities including: detector operability; gain; bias; coherent, impulse and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios (SNR); saturation levels; striping and banding; and the stability of detector performance. The geometric processing subsystem and analysis capabilities support sensor alignment calibrations; sensor chip assembly (SCA)-to-SCA alignments and related issues; geodetic accuracy assessments; modulation transfer function (MTF) characterizations; and perform image-to-image characterizations. The ALIAS also characterizes and corrects band-to-band registration, and performs systematic, precision and terrain correction of ALI images. The ALIAS can geometrically correct and automatically mosaic the SCA image strips into a seamless, map-projected image. The ALIAS was developed through collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).",

This functional paradigm for specifying a domain allows a clean separation between the domain of ontological modeling (i.e., the focus of the OMF Core Functional API) from specific bindings for standards-based technology frameworks such as W3C's OWL, OMG's UML/SysML and, potentially, others. More importantly, the functional nature of this OMF Core API allows decoupling algorithms for analyzing, constructing, auditing, verifying, reasoning about OMF ontological models independently of the particular technology in which these ontological models are represented.",

Conceptually, the scope and purpose of this sbt plugin is very similar to the elegant nice-sbt-settings. Practically, nice-sbt-settings is indeed nicer.",

Stochastic Reduced Order Models (SROMs) are low-dimensional, discrete representations of a given random vector being modeled that facilitate efficient stochastic calculations. SROMs can be viewed as a smart Monte Carlo method - using the concept for uncertainty propagation is similarly straightforward, but can significantly reduce computation time. An SROM is formed for a given target random vector by solving an optimization problem that determines it's parameters by minimizing the error between the statistics of the SROM and the target. Once the SROM is formed, it can be use to efficiently perform a probabilistic analysis. The SROMPy software package is a tool to solve the optimization problem efficiently to generate an SROM that can be used to propagate uncertainty through a given model.",

        "Description": "This tool includes three general types of scripts. The first one extracts average NDVI values from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 image collections for specified reference dates (typically a period of 10-15 years). Anomalies in NDVI values are then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points. The results are also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or NDVI loss (displayed in red). The second types of scripts included scripts that perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates elevation data to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level. These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive, or both. A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified maps generated in the classification scripts. These statistics include total pixel number and total marsh area calculated into square meters after the marsh extent pixels are clipped to our study area (the State of Maryland).",

And now you can explore the same Martian surface in your browser in an immersive WebVR experience. Access Mars features four important mission locations: the Landing Site, Pahrump Hills, Marias Pass, and Murray Buttes. Additionally, users can visit Curiosity's 'Current Location' for a look at where the rover has been in the past two to four weeks. And while you explore it all, JPL scientist Katie Stack Morgan will be your guide, teaching you about key mission details and highlighting points of interest.",

Please refer to  https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access for further details. The package relies on 'curl' (https://curl.haxx.se/) commands and library to access and download data from NASA remote sensing servers.  Since Mac users have curl as part of macOS, Windows users should make sure that their local machines have 'curl' installed properly.  Creating the .netrc file at the user machine 'Home' directory and storing the user NASA GESDISC logging information in it is needed to execute the package commands.
